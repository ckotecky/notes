MARKOV CHAINS
=============


Ex:
---
1. machine with two states - {working, broken}
	- `P[break] = 0.01`
	- `P[continue working] = 0.99`
	- `P[fix] = 0.9`
	- `P[stay broken] = 0.1`
	+ what is the percentage of days the machine is broken?
	+ `P = (0.99 0.01)`
		   `(0.9  0.1 )`

2. corridor with four parts {0,1,2,3}:
	- a spider's web at both ends
	- there is a fly moving through the corridor, starting at 2
	- `P[fly stays] = 0.4`
	- `P[fly moves left] = P[fly moves right] = 0.3`
	- `P[gets caught in web] = 1`
	+ `P = (1   0   0     0)`
		  `(0.3 0.4 0.3   0)`
		  `(0   0.3 0.4 0.3)`
		  `(0   0   0     1)`

1. how to model this?
	- set of states `S` (usually finite, sometimes countable)
	- sequence `X0, X1, ...` of random variables with values in `S`
	- `X{t+1}` depends only on `Xt`
	- `P[X{t+1} = j | Xt = i] = p_{i,j}  for i,j ∈ S`

2. what questions to ask?
	1. `P[machine is broken]` at some random time
	2. 
		- will the fly certainly get eaten?
		- `𝔼[time until getting eaten]`
		- `P[fly ends at 0]` vs `P[fly ends at 3]`


Df: Markov chain
----------------
- sequence of rv `X0, X1, ...` is a **Markov chain** if:
	+ **discrete time**
	+ **discrete space** - `|S| ≤ ω_0`
	+ **homogeneous time**
1. `∃` countable set `S: ∀t: Rng(Xt) ⊆ S`
2. `∀ t ∈ ℕ  ∀ a1, ..., a{t+1} ∈ S: P[X{t+1} = a{t+1} | X0 = a0, X1 = a1, ..., Xt = at] = P[X{t+1} = a{t+1} | Xt = at] = p{at, a{t+1}}` - **transition prob**.
	- memoryless / Markov property
	+ future: `X{t+1}`
	+ present: `Xt`
	+ history: `X0, ..., X{t-1}`


Df: Transition matrix
---------------------
- WMA (= we may assume) `S = [s]` or `S = ℕ`
- **transition matrix** `P = (p{11} p{12} p{13} ...)`
						`(p{21} p{22} ...   ...)`
						`(...   ...   ...   ...)`
	+ `p{ij} ≥ 0`
	+ row sums are 1
	

Df: Transition graph
--------------------
- `V = S`
- `p{i,j} > 0   =>  (i,j) ∈ E`


Df: Distribution of Xk
----------------------
- `π^(k) = (π_1^(k), π_2^(k), ...)`
- `sum = 1`
- `π_j^(k) = P[Xk = j]`


Ex:
---
1. 
	+ `π^(0)` 	initial state given
	+ `π_B^(0) = 1`
	+ `π_W^(0) = 0 	`
	- `π_B^(1) = P{B,B} = P[X1 = B | X0 = B] = 0.1`
	- `π_W^(1) = 0.9`
	- `π_B^(2) = P[X2 = B] = P[X1 = B] * P[X2 = B | X1 = B] + P[X1 = W] * P[X2 = B | X1 = W] = 0.1 * 0.1 + 0.9 * 0.01 = 0.019`
	* `π^(0) = (0, 1)`
	* `π^(1) = (0.9, 0.1)`
	* `π^(2) = (0.981, 0.019)`
	
3. general
	+ `P[X1 = j] = Σ{i ∈ [s]} P[X0 = i] * P[X1 = j | X0 = i]`
		* `P[X1 = j | X0 = i] = P[X2 = j | X1 = i]`
	+ `π_j^(1) = Σ{i ∈ [s]} π_i^(0) * p{i,j}`
	+ `π^(1) = π^(0) * P`   (row vector * matrix)
	+ `P[X1 = i] * P[X2 = j | X1 = i]`
	+ `π^(2) = π^(1) * P = (π^(0) * P) * P = π^(0) * P^2`


Th: Memoryless property
-----------------------
- for any **Markov chain** with transition matrix `P`:
- `π^(k) = π^(0) * P^k`   `and   π^(k+t) = π^(t) * P^k`

### Proof:
- by induction `π^(k+1) = π^(k) * P = π^(0) * P^k * P = π^(0) * P^{k + 1}`
- same as `π^(1) = π^(0) * P`   (row vector * matrix)


Df: k-step transition
---------------------
- `r_{ij}(k) = P[i to j in k steps] = P[Xk = j | X0 = i] = P[X{t+k} = j | Xt = i]`
- `r_{ij}(1) = p_{ij}`


Ob:
---
- `r_{ij}(k) = π_j^(k)  if  π^(0) = (0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0)`   (unit vector, has 1 only on position i)
+ `π_j^(k) = (π^(0) * P^k)j = ((0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0) P^k)j = (P^k){ij}`


Th: Chapman - Kolmogorov formula
--------------------------------
1. `r_{ij}(k) = (P^k){ij}`
2. `r_{ij}(k+l) = Σ{t ∈ [s]} r_{it}(k) * r_{tj}(l)`
3. `t_{ij}(k+1) = Σ{t ∈ [s]} r_{it}(k) * p_{tj}`


Df: Acessible state
-------------------
- state `j` is **acessible** from state `j (j ∈ A(i): i -> j)
<=>   P[∃k ≥ 0: Xk = j | X0 = i] > 0 
<=>   Σ{k ∈ ℕ_0} r_{ij}(k) > 0  
<=>   ∃k: P[Xk = j | X0 = i] > 0
<=>   ∃ directed path from i to j in the transition graph`


Df: Communicating states
------------------------
- `i,j ∈ S` communicate `(i <-> j)   <=>   i -> j  ∧  j -> i`


Lm: 
---
- state communication is an equivalence

### Proof:
1. 
	- `i -> i`  for `k = 0`
	- `r_{ii}(0) = 1`   by definition
2. `i <-> j  <=>  j <-> i`   by definition
3. 
	- `i <-> j <-> t`
	- we want `i -> t` and `t -> j`
	- by the directed path formulation, the paths can be joined
	- if the two paths intersect, we can remove the loop
	- so it is always a path
