Df: Poisson process properties
------------------------------
1. `𝔼[Tk] = Σ 𝔼[Li] = k/λ`
2. `var[Tk] = Σ{i ∈ [k]} var[Li] = k/λ^2`
3. `f{Tk}(t) = λ^k * t^{k-1} * e^{-λt} / (k - 1)!` - Erlang distribution


Ex:
---
- queue of `k` people in front of an office
- the office is `~ Exp(λ)`  where  `1/λ = 1` minutes
- `Tk` = time at which are done
- `𝔼[Tk] = k` minutes
- `P[Tk > k + 5] = ∫{k+5}^∞ f{Tk}(t) dt`


Ob:
---
1. `k = 1  =>  λe^{-λt} ~ Exp(λ)`
2. `k = 2  =>  f{Tk}(s) = ∫{0^s} f{Tk}(t) λe^{-λ(s - t)} dt`


Ob:
---
- `P[t ≤ Tk ≤ t + δ] = ∫_s^{s + δ} f{Tk}(t) dt ≐ δ * f{Tk}(s)`
- `-> P[1 arrival  in [s, s + δ]   ∧   k - 1 arrivals in [0, s]]`
- intervals are practically disjoint
- `= P[Ns = k - 1] * P[Nδ = 1] = e^{-λs} * (λs)^{k - 1} / (k - 1)! * e^{-λδ} * λ / 1! * δ`
	+ `Ns ~ Pois(λs)`
	+ `Nδ ~ Pois(λδ)`
	+ `e^{-λδ} ≐ 1`
- in more rigorous terms `f(x) = lim{δ -> 0} 1/δ ∫_x^{x + δ} f(t)`



Poisson process splitting
-------------------------


Ex: Poisson process splitting
-----------------------------
- packets arrive to a router according to `Pp(λ)`
- each packet is (independent of everything) \{
	- local 			probability `p`
	- from outside  	probability `1 - p`
1. local pocket form 			`Pp(λp)`
2. outside pockets form 		`Pp(λ(1 - p))`
	- the two are independent
1. waiting times for some packet 		`~ Exp(λ)`
2. waiting times for local packet 		`~ Exp(λp)`
3. waiting times for outside packet 	`~ Exp(λ(1 - p))`


Ob: Poisson process splitting
-----------------------------
- `P[k, τ]` for `Pp(λ)`
- for local packets: `P[k arrivals] = Σ{n = k}^∞ P[n, τ] * P[Bin(n, p) = k]`
	+ `P[n, τ]`  			n total packets
	+ `P[Bin(n, p) = k]`  	k of them are local
	1. this is some `= P'[k, τ]`
	2. independent
	3. `P'[k, τ] ≤ P[k, τ] = o(1)` for `k ≥ 2`
		- `P[1, τ] = λτ * p + o(1)`


Ex:
---
- `X = #` of arrivals of local packets during time `[1,2]`
- `Y = #` of arrivals of outside packets during time `[1,2]`
- `X ~ Pois(λp)`
- `Y ~ Pois(λ(1 - p))`
- are they independent?
+ independence `<=(def)=> P[X = k ∧ Y = l] = P[X = k] * P[Y = l]`
	- `P[X = k] * P[Y = l] = e^{-λp} * (λp)^k . k! * e^{-λ(1 - p)} * (λ (1 - p))^l / e!`
	- `P[X = k ∧ Y = l] = P[X + Y = k + l] * P[Bin(k + k, p) = k]`
		- `P[X + Y = k + l] = P[Pois(λ) = k + l]`
		- `P[Bin(k + k, p) = k] = P[X = k | X + Y = k + l]`
	- `e^{-λ} λ^{k + l} * (k + l)! * (k+l  k) * p^k * (1 - p)^l`


Poisson process merging
-----------------------


Ex: Poisson process merging
---------------------------
- people arriving at a post office
1. some are going to send a letter, they form `Pp(λ)`
2. others want to pick up a letter, they form `Pp(λ')`

1. we assume the groups are independent
- all together form `Pp(λ + λ')`
	- first arriving time for sending - `T ~ Exp(λ)`
	- first arriving time for recieving - `T' ~ Exp(λ')`
	- all together get arriving time `T1 = min(T, T')`
		+ => `P[T1 > t] = P[T > t ∧ T' > t] = P[T > t] * P[T' > t]`
		+ `= e^{-λt} * e^{-λ't} = e^{-(λ + λ')t}`
		+ => `T ~ Exp(λ + λ')`	

2. suppose `T1 = T' = t` (first custommer arrived at time t to recieve a letter)
	1. now waiting time for next person recieving is again `~ Exp(λ')`
	2. `{T - t | T > t} ~ Exp(λ)`
		- `P[T - t > s | T > t] = P[T > s + t ∧ t > t] / P[T > t] = e^{-λ(s + t)} / e^{-λt} * e^{-λs}`
		- memoryless property of `Exp, Geom`


Ob: Poisson process merging
---------------------------
- merging processes `Pp(λ)` for `λ1, ..., λn`, we get `Pp(λ1 + ... + λn)`


Ex: Poisson process merging
---------------------------
- three tellers at the bank
- each serves a customer in time `Exp(λ)` where `1/λ = 10` minutes
- people served by teller A `~ Pp(λ)` => people served by A,B or C `~ Pp(λ + λ + λ) = Pp(3λ)`
- => wating time `~ Exp(3λ),  𝔼 = 1/3λ = 10/3` minutes
- => `P[waiting time ≥ 1/λ] = e^{-3λ * 1/λ} = e^{-3} ~ 5%`
- `P[waiting time for B] = e^{-λ * 1/λ} = e^{-1} ~ 37%`


Ex: Poisson process merging
---------------------------
- a person being served by A,B and C - all are occupied
- we are the only one person in the queue
- `P[we are the last person to leave the bank] = 1/3`
- all are equally likely because of the memoryless property
